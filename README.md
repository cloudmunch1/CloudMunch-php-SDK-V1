##Sample Plugin     
 
Let us look at a sample plugin that prints "Hello "+ "string passed at runtime" on execution.
Plugin name : Hello
Input: helloname: This need to be printed out with Hello.
 
Step1: Create a folder "Hello"
Step2: Create a file plugin.json with the following contents,

```
{
  "id": "Hello",
  "name": "Hello,
  "author": "rosmi@cloudmunch.com",
  "version": "1",
  "status": "enabled",
  "tags": ["git","checkout"],
  "inputs": {
    "helloname": {
      "type": "text",
        "mandatory": "yes",
      "display": "yes", 
      "label": "Name",
      "hint": "Give the name to be printed"    
    }
  },
  "outputs": {
    "param1": {
      "name": "",
      "format": ""
    }
  },
  "execute": {
    "main": "Hello/src/HelloDisplay.php",
    "language": "PHP",
    "options": "-debug"
  },
  "documentation": {
    "description": "Prints Hello"
  },
  "_created_by": "rosmi@cloudmunch.com",
  "_create_time": "2015-10-01 06:23:25.0474",
  "_updated_by": "rosmi@cloudmunch.com",
  "_update_time": ""
}
 ```
 
Step 3:
Create composer.json to download Cloudmunch PHP SDK 
```
 {
"require": 
   {
    "cloudmunch/php-sdk-v2":"dev-master"
   }
}
``` 

Step 4:
Create a folder 'src'.
Create a file , HelloDisplay.php.
This file will have all the life cycle methods to control the plugin execution.
```
<?php
require_once dirname(__FILE__) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . '../src/HelloDisplay.class.php';
 
$hellodisplay= new HelloDisplay();
$hellodisplay->initialize();
$processInput = $hellodisplay->getProcessInput();
$hellodisplay->process($processInput);
 
?>
```

Step 5:
Create a file HelloDisplay.class.php

```
<?php
require_once dirname(__FILE__) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR .'../vendor/autoload.php';
use CloudMunch \ AppAbstract;
class HelloDisplay extends AppAbstract
{
  
    public function process($processparameters)
    {
        $inputparameters    = $processparameters['appInput'];
        $name       = $inputparameters->helloname;
       echo "HELLO  ".$name;
    }
}
?>
```

Step 6:
Create file install.sh, this will have scripts to install dependencies for your plugin.
```
#!/bin/bash
BASEDIR=$(dirname "$0")
echo "Script location: ${BASEDIR}"
cd "${BASEDIR}"
#Install composer
if hash composer 2>/dev/null; then
echo "Composer is available"
else
echo "Installing composer ..."
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
fi
composer install
 ```



##Using Integrations

Cloudmunch has an integration framework using which plugins can interact with any external service providers.
For example if the plugin need to interact with Amazon web services, the account can be registered in cloudmunch integrations page.
This integration will now be available for the plugin at runtime. The details can be retrieved in the plugin with the following code sample,

 ```php
public function process($processparameters)
    {
        $inputparameters    = $processparameters['appInput'];
        $integrationdetails = $processparameters['integrationdetails'];
 
        $awsacesskey = $integrationdetails['accessKey'];
 
        $secretkey   = $integrationdetails['secretKey'];
    }
```

##Logging framework

Any event in the plugin has to be logged so that the plugin report will give enough information to the end user. There is a logging framework in the SDK and this has to be used.
Following types of messages are supported,
DEBUG, INFO and ERROR.
Here is the sample code to output log messages,
```
$this->getLogHandler()->log(INFO, “Info message”);
$this->getLogHandler()->log(DEBUG, “Debug message”);
```

##Handling failure scenarios
 The plugin should exit with error on any failure scenarios.To enable this SDK provides a method to exit with error. The format to invoke the event is as below,
 ```
    $message = "Error message”;
    trigger_error($message, E_USER_ERROR);
    ```
